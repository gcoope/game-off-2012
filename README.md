## Flying Fork Fandango

Given the challenge to try and create a game loosely based off one of the following:

* forking (or forks)
* branching (or branches)
* cloning (or clones)
* pushing
* pulling

I decided to go with forks. Because...forks.

## The Game

I'm simply going to create a game where you're a hand gliding ninja who's dropping forks onto unsuspecting rabbits.

# Instructions

* Up, left and right will steer your hang glider around
* Pressing F will drop a fork
* Space to start a game when prompted
* R to restart when you inevitably crash
