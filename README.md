## Flying Fork Fandango

Given the challenge to try and create a game loosely based off one of the following:

* forking (or forks)
* branching (or branches)
* cloning (or clones)
* pushing
* pulling

I decided to go with forks. Because...forks.

## The Game

I'm simply going to create a game where you're a hand gliding ninja who's dropping forks onto unsuspecting rabbits. This is my very first game ever using HTML5 canvas so I don't expect it to be very good, I do however expect to learn a lot from it.
